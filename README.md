## About
Command line tool that gives a concise explanation of a given command, along with example usage. I got this idea from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/7pnw2e/fun_golang_projects/) reddit post, and is pretty much just a copy of [github.com/mstruebing/tldr]. Copying this is not very creative, but I just wanted an excuse to get started in Go and I didn't want to wait for "inspiration." That being said, this is entirely my own code.
